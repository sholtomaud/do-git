# do-git

A node.js command line utility for deploying docker containers from Git repos, i.e. continuous integration.

# Why

It can be a little annoying to assemble all the right bits for getting your docker project to a staging or production server on a Git push release command.

So do-git is a command line wrapper around Docker and Git enabling you to push a git release to a production server docker container on a Git push.

do-git came out of and replaces docker-utilities which will be retired.
